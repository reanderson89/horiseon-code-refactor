# horiseon-code-refactor

    Thank you for the opportunity to work with you and your company. The code given to me was in great working order and had good details to work with. 

# The changes I made to your webpage

    My goal with this assignment was to try and simplify and also add some extra detail to make it easier to assess from the outside looking in. Some of the major changes I made was changing all of the <div> tags to relate to their respective sections. You will now see a <header> tag after the initial <body> tag. This is followed by a <main> tag which is where the horizontal info bars live, and an <aside> tag where the vertical bar on the right side of the page is. At the end you will find the <footer> tag to bring the page to a close.

    Since the above mentioned were mainly HTML changes I will continue by going through the other changes made to the HTML...

    I added a title to the page;

    - "alt=" were added to images to help with accessibility for the page.

    - An additional "id=" was added to the "search engine optimization" section to ensure the link worked.

    - Changed/added some classes in order to help simplify some CSS.

    - Added comments throughout to help find information faster.

   ------------------------- 

    Changes made to the CSS:

    - Went through and combined classes with similar attributes that were in the same sections as one another.

    - Made changes to names of brackets to ensure that the HTML matched properly and didn't change the page.

    - Changed the flow of the CSS so that it mimics the HTML flow.

    - Added comments to each bracket so that it is easy to find the area of formatting you are looking for.

#   Thank you

    Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns with any of the changes made. I will gladly walk through my thought process on anything you would like.
